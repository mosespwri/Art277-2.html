            <h2>can vaccinated people transmit <uppercase>covid</uppercase>-19 to other?</h2>
<p> Get the answer from an infectious disease specialist<br><br>
    <img src="aa.png" alt="hand"/>
We’ve heard it all since the pandemic started — lemon juice can kill the coronavirus, masks don’t work, if you
already had <u>COVID-19</u> you can’t get it again or that the vaccines approved for emergency use will change your
DNA or put a tracking device in your body.<br><br>
<a href="https//www.facebook.com">Send Us Email</a><br><br> 
It’s almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the misinformation. But despite all the
myths and urban legends, about half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.<br><br>
Wonderful news, right?<br><br>
Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up against a new set of myths — they’re literally magnetic or they’re
going to shed vaccine components and alter the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite the extra layer of
protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else.
So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread COVID-19 to
others? Infectious disease specialist <u>Lyssette Cardona,</u> MD, answers those questions and covers why
vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight against COVID-19.</p>

 <h2><q>Fully vaccinated</q> doesn’t <q>mean immune to COVID-19</q></h2><br>
<p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard
down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected.<br><br>
Dr. Cardona explains.<br><br><q>‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best
protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being
exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.</q><br><br>
<h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,
including other vaccinated people?</h2><br><br>
While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds
that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.<br><br>
<q>The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may
not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data
and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.</q></p>
